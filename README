# Purrfect Pix Backend

This is the backend for the Purrfect Pix application. The frontend for this application is available [here](https://github.com/NGFuture/2024_purrfect_pix_fe).

This backend is built using Python Django and uses PostgreSQL for the database. Additionally, it uses an API key from [The Cat API](https://thecatapi.com/).

## Installation Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or later
- PostgreSQL
- Virtualenv (optional but recommended)

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/NGFuture/2024_purrfect_pix_be
    cd 2024_purrfect_pix_be
    ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended)**

    ```
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install the required packages**

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Set up the PostgreSQL database**

    - Create a new PostgreSQL database:

      ```sql
      CREATE DATABASE purrfect_pix_db;
      ```

    - Create a new PostgreSQL user and grant all privileges on the database:

      ```sql
      CREATE USER purrfect_pix WITH PASSWORD 'password';
      GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE purrfect_pix_db TO purrfect_pix;
      ```

5. **Configure the environment variables**

    Create a `settings.py` file by using example `settings.example.py` and update following variables:

    ```python
    SECRET_KEY='your_secret_key_here'  # Replace with a long, randomly generated string.
    ```
    ```python
    CAT_API_KEY='your_secret_key_here'  # Replace with a key obtained on https://thecatapi.com/.
    ```

    If your frontend makes requests to this backend and you need to allow cross-origin requests (CORS), adjust the allowed origins in your settings:
    ```python
    CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS = [
        'http://localhost:3000',  # example: React development server
        'https://example.com',    # example: Your production frontend URL
    ]
    ```
    Replace `'http://localhost:3000'` and `'https://example.com'` with the actual origins (URLs) you want to allow. This step is necessary to ensure that your frontend can communicate with the backend API without CORS issues.

6. **Apply the database migrations**

    ```
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

7. **Run the development server**

    For the first time after the previous steps:

    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

    For all subsequent starts after the project is installed:

    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    python manage.py runserver
    ```


The backend should now be running locally. You can access it at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

## Project Structure

- `purrfect_pix/`: Contains the main project settings and configurations.
- `cats/`: Contains the application logic for handling cat-related data.

## API Key

This project uses an API key from [The Cat API](https://thecatapi.com/). Ensure that you have a valid API key and configure it in your environment variables as shown above.
